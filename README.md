Tasks
To complete this assignment, each group needs to do the following:

Repository Initialization. As indicated above, groups have two options when initializing their group repository OSU-CS361-W17/group##_project2.

Selecting the previously developed code in your group's Project Stage 1 repository (OSU-CS361-W17/group##_project1) to use as the basis for this stage.
Or selecting the code developed by the instructors and provided in the course's Project Stage 2 repository (OSU-CS361-W17/project2 (Links to an external site.)) to use as the basis for this stage.
For either option, follow the Importing between GitHub repositories page for instructions on how to easily import your selected repository code into your group's Project Stage 2 repository.

Select a Target Platform. As a group, decide on a target platform (i.e. type of device) and layout for your updated Battleship game. Designing for a vertical iPad layout is much different than a 16:9 laptop screen. Input method will also inform design decisions (e.g. touchscreen, mouse, joystick). Add a description of both the target platform and the layout on the wiki pages of your group's Project Stage 2 repository.

Select a Target User. As a group, decide on a specific user population that could reasonably be assumed to want to play the Battleship game on your selected platform and layout. Add a description of this target user on the wiki pages of your group's Project Stage 2 repository. Note that your description should include user characteristics that can help you make design and usability decisions about your updated Battleship game.

Create 3 Different Designs on Paper. Each group member should create 3 different designs for the UI and basic interactions of your updated Battleship game. These should be hand drawn on paper, or sketched on a tablet (the point is to provide a rough sketch for your fellow group members to understand your ideas). Each drawing should be labeled with the authors name. You can submit these in class on Thursday, February 16 or online within the wiki page on your group's Project Stage 2 repository.

Select 3 Best Designs. As a group, you should vote for the 3 best designs from the individually developed designs (i.e. a team of 4 would have 12 designs from which 3 would be selected). The selected designs should meet the needs of the target platform and the target user previously selected. The 3 selected designs should have an indicator on them prior to being submitted in class on Thursday, February 16 or online within the wiki page on your group's Project Stage 2 repository.

Merge Selected Designs into a Paper Prototype. As a group, create a new design prototype that merges the best ideas from the 3 selected designs. This prototype will be your group's framework for developing an updated Battleship game, so the quality of the sketch should be more complete than in previous designs. For this prototype, you will create three different states of the design:
Regular: This is how the interface will look when the user is in the middle of playing a game.
Blank: This is how the interface will look when the user starts a new game.
Error: This is how the interface will look when the user tries to do an illegal move.

Implement Paper Prototype as a New View. Groups should divide the work equally for implementing the prototype. User stories are not required for developing the tasks, but it is a good exercise to at least use INVEST (Links to an external site.) when determining tasks for each group member. Tasks must be added into the GitHub Issue page on your group's Project Stage 2 repository. Each group member must have at least one issue assigned to them, and that task must involve implementation code that is added via Pull Request. Each group member is also responsible for constructively commenting on another group member's Pull Request.
